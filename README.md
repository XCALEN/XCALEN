  👋 Hey there! I'm Naitik, a high school sophomore who spends too much time debugging code and not enough time debugging life. 🧑‍💻

🔍 Research Enthusiast: I enjoy delving into topics that most people find too complex to Research. Whether it's AI, physics, or why my code only breaks when I show it to someone, I love the thrill of discovery.

💻 Aspiring Programmer: Programming is like magic—except the compiler is always out to prove you're not a real person. I build projects, solve problems, and occasionally question my life choices when an issue turns out to be a missing semicolon.

🏸 Varsity Badminton Player: Off the keyboard and onto the court, I smash birdies and sometimes to the net. Badminton teaches me discipline, strategy, and how to recover from a bad drop shot—much like debugging.

🔬 Passion for Pre-Research: If there's an unsolved mystery in the universe, I'm probably overanalyzing it. From quantum mechanics to AI ethics, I love exploring the unknown and pretending I have all the answers.

🚀 My journey is just beginning—unless recursion is involved, in which case, I might be stuck here forever. Let's connect and figure out this adventure together! 🌌,
